    Next, we would like you to instead consider <strong>temporary job creation</strong> looking <div style="color: fuchsia;">backward</div>.  So, the next section is about your views of job creation now, a year ago, and five years ago.
    <br>
    <br>
    First, we will ask you several questions about temporary (1-year contract) jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong> and temporary jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    For each question, you will again see 6 options of how to distribute jobs across periods, but this time they represent jobs in the <div style="color: fuchsia;">past</div>. As before, the response buttons represent different combinations of jobs created. Again, you decide how to distribute jobs created between the two periods to represent the best economy. 
    <br>
    <br>
    When you are ready to select the combination of jobs created that you think represents <strong>the best economy</strong>, click “Next”. Remember, there are no “right” or “wrong” answers.
