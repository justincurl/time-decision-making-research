    The next section of this survey is about your views of <strong>temporary job creation</strong> now, a year ago, and five years ago. Studies have shown that temporary job creation is beneficial to both job candidates and employers.
    <br>
    <br>
    First, we will ask you several questions about temporary (1-year contract) jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong> and temporary jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    In each question, you will be able to indicate which combination of temporary jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong> and <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong> you think represents the best economy. Some people might think the best economy would have created all temporary jobs {{curr_block.text_total_end}} even though that would have meant higher unemployment {{curr_block.text_delay_start}}. Other people may think the best economy would have created all temporary jobs {{curr_block.text_delay_start}} even though that would have meant higher unemployment {{curr_block.text_total_end}}. Still others may think the best economy would have divided the number of jobs created between the two periods in some way.
