<div text-align="justify" style="font-size: large;">
The next section of this survey is about your views of <span style="color: orange">future</span> <strong>temporary job creation</strong> 
now, a year from now, and five years from now. 
<br>
<br>
First, we will ask you several questions about temporary (1-year contract) jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong> and 
temporary jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong>. 
<br>
<br>
In each question, you will be able to indicate which combination of temporary jobs created <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong> and <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong> 
you think represents the best economy. Some people might think the best economy creates all temporary jobs <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong> 
even though that means higher unemployment <strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong>. Other people may think the best economy creates all temporary jobs 
<strong>{{curr_block.text_total_end}}</strong> even though that means higher unemployment <strong>{{curr_block.text_delay_start}}</strong>. Still others may think the best 
economy divides the number of jobs created between the two periods.
