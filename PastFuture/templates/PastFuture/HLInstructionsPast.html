        On the following 9 pages, we would like you to imagine you are looking backward at <strong>past economic growth
            over a four-year period.</strong>
        <br><br>
        You will see figures with the measurements of how much better off people were in each year, and you will be
        asked to evaluate each of these past periods of growth.
        <br><br>
        The measurements shown are <strong>personal income growth:</strong> the percentage by which the average person’s
        income increased
        in each year. This provides a good measure of how strong the national economy was.
        <br><br>
        After looking at a figure, you’ll be asked to evaluate economy growth during this period. Would you say the
        national economy was very good, fairly good, fairly bad, or very bad?
        <br><br>
        <strong>Here’s an example:</strong>
    <div align="center"><img src={{instructions_image_link}} width=70%></div>
    The example figure shows that incomes will grow by 1.9 percent in the first year, then by 2.1 percent in the second
    year, then by 2.5 percent in the third year, and by 2.0 percent in the fourth (most recent) year.
    <br><br>
    In this example, the person making the evaluation thought the past economy was “fairly good” during this period, and
    therefore marked the third button from the left.
    <br><br>
    Remember, you are looking at a <strong>past economic growth,</strong> so the fourth year of the four-year period
    is the most recent, while the first year of the period was several years earlier.
