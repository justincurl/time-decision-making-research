# prior-time
oTree app designed by Justin Curl for Professor Markus Prior in the Princeton Politics Department to measure intertemporal choices using the graphical representation of economic growth from Healy & Lenz and the Convex Time Budget Analysis method created by Charles Sprenger and James Andreoni. 

This app is a modified version of the "otime" oTree app created by Julia and Michael Rose (see original version here: https://github.com/rose-m/otime).

This version allows for greater flexibility in the options presented to the experiment participants, allowing you to present non-number values
to participants. We hope this will allow us to test CTB's applicability in political experiments concerning time.
