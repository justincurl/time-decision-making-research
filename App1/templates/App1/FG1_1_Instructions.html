    The next section of this survey is about your views of <strong>temporary job creation</strong> now, a year from now, and five years from now. Studies have shown that temporary job creation is beneficial to both job candidates and employers.
<br>
<br>
First, we will ask you several questions about temporary (1-year contract) jobs created <strong>{{earlier_time}}</strong> and temporary jobs created <strong>{{later_time}}</strong>.
<br>
<br>
In each question, you will be able to indicate which combination of temporary jobs created <strong>{{earlier_time}}</strong> and <strong>{{later_time}}</strong> you think represents <strong>the best economy</strong>. Some people might think the best economy would create all temporary jobs {{earlier_time}} even though that would mean higher unemployment {{later_time}}. Other people may think the best economy would create all temporary jobs {{later_time}} even though that would mean higher unemployment {{earlier_time}}. Still others may think the best economy would divide the number of jobs created between the two periods in some way.
