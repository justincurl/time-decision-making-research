        On the following 6 pages, we would now like you to imagine you are looking <strong>backward</strong> at
        <strong>past economic growth</strong> over
        a four-year period.
        <br><br>
        This time, you will see figures with measurements of how much better off people were in <strong>two different
            years</strong> of
        this four-year period. The measurements shown are again <strong>personal income growth:</strong> the percentage
        by which the average person’s income increased in a given year.
        <br><br>
        You will again be asked to choose which combination of economic growth in a two-year period you think was best.
        Each screen asks about a different pair of years in the past, four-year period – <strong>please pay close
            attention to
            which two of the four past years you are asked to consider.</strong>
