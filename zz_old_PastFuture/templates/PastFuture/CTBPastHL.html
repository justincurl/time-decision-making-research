        On the following 6 pages, we would again like you to imagine you are looking backward at past economic growth
        over a four-year period.
        <br><br>
        You will see figures with measurements of how much better off people were in <strong>two different years of this
            four-year period.</strong> The measurements shown are again <strong>personal income growth:</strong> the
        percentage by which the average person’s income increased in a given year.
        <br><br>
        You will be asked to choose which combination of economic growth in a two-year period you think was best. As you
        will see, there is a trade-off: As growth went down for one year, it went up for the other. Each screen asks
        about a different pair of years – <strong>please pay close attention to which two of the four past years you are
            asked
            to consider.</strong>
        <br><br>
        Here’s an <strong>example:</strong>

    <div align="center"><img src={{instructions_image_link}} width=70%></div>
    The example shows combinations of growth in the <strong>second year</strong> and the <strong>fourth year</strong> of
    the four-year period. There are six different options to choose from. For example, the leftmost response button
    combines 2 percent growth in the second year and 0 percent growth in the fourth (more recent) year. The rightmost
    button combines 0 percent growth in the second year and 2.5 percent growth in the fourth year.
    <br><br>
    In this example, the person making the decision thought that 1.2 percent growth in the second year and 1 percent in
    the more recent fourth year was the best economy overall, and therefore marked the third button from the left.
    <br><br>
    Remember, you are choosing between pairs of <strong>past economic growth,</strong> so the fourth year was more
    recent than the second
    year of the period.
