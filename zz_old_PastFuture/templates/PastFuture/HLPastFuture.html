        On the following 8 pages, we would now like you to imagine you are looking <strong>backward</strong> at
        <strong>past economic growth</strong> over a four-year period.
        <br><br>
        You will see figures with the measurements of how much better off people were in each year of this four-year
        period. The measurements shown are again <strong>personal income growth:</strong> the percentage by which the
        average person’s income increased in each year.
        <br><br>
        After looking at a figure, you’ll similarly be asked to evaluate economy growth during this period. Would you
        say the national economy was very good, fairly good, fairly bad, or very bad?
